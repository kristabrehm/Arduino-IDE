//For this project, I took creativity from the 'wearable technology' aspect of the explanation.
//Not necessarily an extension of the human body, my sensor Kentucky Derby Hat is designed to
//use a water sensor and 1. alert the individual that it is raining, and 2. do so in a whimsical way such that
//featherts on the hat move back an forth, mimicking wings. The hat is designed to still look 
//stylish for the event as well. 

//Servo Motor Variables

//Pizeo Speaker Variable
const int buzzer = 8; //buzzer to arduino pin 8

//Water Sensor Variables

//PIR Motion Sensor Variables
const int PIN_TO_SENSOR = 6;   // the pin that OUTPUT pin of sensor is connected to

//LED Variable

    pinMode(PIN_TO_SENSOR, INPUT);  // set arduino pin to input mode to read value from OUTPUT pin of sensor

    pinMode(led1, OUTPUT);          //Set up LED

    myservo.attach(9);              // attaches the servo on pin 9 to the servo object

//The below if loop correlates to the water sensor:
//If water is detected and the resval is >= 100, the piezo speaker goes off.
//In addition, the movement of the feathers, "wings," is also controlled here. In the case that
//water is detected, the servo motor utilizes sweep to essential osciliate back and forth until no
//more water is detected. It will stop once water is no longer detected.

    //We are using sweep for the servo movement so we will be using 2 for loops for the

    //that they will only be reached when the if statement is true.
