# Arduino
In this repository, find example code utilizing the Arduino IDE. Each folder contains the code for the projects, however it is up to the user to correctly wire all elements and physically construct the piece. Emphasizing the basic skills required to build physical-computing systems through a series of practical tutorials and design challenges, ASU AME 240 (Physical Computing) highlighted both sensors and acuators and basic fabrication with hand and CNC tools, including electronic design fundamentals, circuit construction techniques, and introductory microcontroller programming.

Each folder additionally contains direct links to video explanations of each project.

In the Smart Home file, find the code behind a smart home project - a series of automated, logic - oriented buzzers, LEDs, buzzers, and motors. This project is equally focused on code, wiring, and construction.

In the Kinetic Light Sculpture file, find code correlating to the usage of a DotStar LED strip using FastLED(). Additionally, the code deals with the usage of a servo motor. This project focuses more on the code in Arduino.
